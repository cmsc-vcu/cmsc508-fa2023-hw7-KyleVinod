# Creating a Database using DDL

This project practices with creating a database and filling in sample data.
The project would then display different database details and have
different tables work together to display them. It wasn't easy getting 
the different parts of the database to work together, but I was able to 
create the database and display the different ways the database works.
All files are in the hw7 folder. Kyle Vinod did all the work.
